# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

What's 4 Dinner has set out to make finding new recipes that fit your specific taste and dietary needs easier. What’s 4 Dinner’s mission is to aid in the decision-making process of what to eat for a meal and suggest new and exciting recipes to its users, all while filtering recipes by elements such as price, ingredient availability, and much more.

## Methods

The What’s 4 Dinner team has completed heuristic evaluations as well as a competitive analysis of competing platforms in the market. In our heuristic evaluations, we analyzed the functionality of the platforms, the aesthetic of them, as well as their ease of use. 

Key points we focused on for the functionality of these platforms include their error systems, specifically if they often prevent errors from occurring and how they respond to errors that have happened. An additional key point we focused on was the viability of the systems and sought to find out if feedback was given to the user while interacting with the platform. 

To investigate the ease of use for the user, we looked into how much control and freedom the user had over the platform, if it was flexible to different skill levels, if it was efficient to use, and finally whether the user had to recall what they were searching for or if it was easily recognizable.

For the aesthetics of the platforms, we focused on how minimal or maximal the design of the platform appeared, how it was organized, and if it was clear to understand.
For our competitive analysis, we dissected the strengths and weaknesses of competing platforms, their quality, and finally what the cost of use was for the user


## Findings

In our heuristic evaluation we focused on one main competitor, Company A, and dissected their platform.

We found the functionality of their platform to be satisfactory. For their error prevention and recovery system, we found that while their error prevention is lacking in some cases, the recovery for the user after committing an error is simple and swift. For example, when creating an account on Company A, there are no password requirements visible. After the user creates a password that failed the requirements, they would then appear and the user could try again. This could be easily improved by making the requirements available at the start. The visibility of the systems in Company A was adequate. While some components, such as password requirements, were not visible, overall the user actions we clearly visible on the platform and it gave prompt and helpful feedback to the user.

For ease of use for the user, we found that Company A was proficient. The user had plently control and freedom while moving throughout the platform and was able to jump from page to page without needing to manually back out of each one. The flexibility of the platform was adequate as well as there were options spanning from novice to expert levels of recipes. Company A’s platform had an average efficiency of use. No shortcut discoveries were made when moving throughout the platform.

Company A’s platform is of minimal design and appears simplistic. All fonts are easy to read and all colors stand out from one another. Their minimal design makes their platform easy to navigate through as well as prevents it from being overwhelming to look at. The organization of Company A’s platform is standard. Pages and search results are broken up into categories that are easily located and available on every page of the platform.

For the competitive analysis our team completed, we focus on seven prominent competitors in the market.

Strengths we found to be common among these competitors included a user's ability to upload their own recipes, the ability to save and organize interesting recipes, features that created editable grocery lists for multiple recipes at once, as well as the organization of recipes into helpful categories for the user. Strengths that were unique to individual competitors include adjustable serving sizes on recipes as well as listing all utensils and kitchenware needed to complete recipes.

Weaknesses found from the majority of the competitors evaluated included the platforms being swarmed with advertisements and confusing user interfaces. These weaknesses were most common with websites, while apps and physical cookbooks were better organized and had fewer advertisements.

The quality of all competitors evaluate ranged from average to high. The price range for these apps reflected their quality, ranging from free to $24.99 a year, with the most common price being $4.99 per month. For multiple of the free platforms, their highest-quality features were locked behind a paywall that required a subscription to access, rendering them useless to the rest of the app.


## Conclusions

Using various research methods, we were able to narrow our scope of how our website should perform. 

The competitive analysis our team performed proved a solid foundation for us to begin our research. We were able to aim our focus in a forward-thinking direction and go from there.

The findings from our heuristic evaluation were exceptionally useful. Company A was able to provide a proper foundation of intelligent UX design, specifically in the areas of error handling, user freedom and control, and minimalistic design. 

As for user freedom and control, we are considering implementing an interactable web page path for simple and responsive navigation. Our team will also incorporate many aspects of the minimal UX Design of Company A such as the navigation bar and sleek, scrollable home page design. And finally in regard to error recovery, we will make certain it is clear to the user where the error visually lies, and simple instruction on changes that must be made to recover.

We have also explored the caveats of Company A’s website such as error prevention, which we improve upon by making sure that all features behave as expected in their mental model. 


## Caveats

The largest caveat our team came across was within our competitive analysis. There were many applications and websites with premium features that were inaccessible for our team to access, and therefore inaccessible to compare. There were also entire applications that were locked behind a paywall, leaving us with no collected data.

# What's For Dinner

What's for Dinner is a website intended to make it easier for someone to find a recipe they can cook, give them all the tools to help understand the recipes, and allow them to curate a cookbook of the recipes they love and want to share with everyone.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

It can be very challenging figuring out what to eat 3 times a day and harder still if you are under any sort of dietary restrictions. **What's For Dinner will allow a user to have access to a collection of recipes tailored for them,** making the decision of What's For Dinner much easier. We've done some research to find opportunities to improve the user experience.

**Competative Analysis** of leading products revealed **opportunities for improvement** for multiple segments:
* **Advertisements**: Users displeased with **advertisements swarming the user interface**
* **Pay Walls**: A lot of **useful functionality hidden behind monthly paywalls**
* **Tutorials**: Sometimes **kitchen jargon is confusing** for inexperienced users and **few competitors** provided **definitions of jargon and tutorials for tasks** 
* **Shopping List**: Many platforms allowed for the **creation of a shopping list** but few took into account **ingredients you already have**
**Heuristic evaluation** of a competitor showed that navigation of the site was easily learnable but some functionality was hidden from the user at first glance.
* New Personas and Scenarios reflect what we have learned through our analyses and our goals moving forward:

   -**Setting Calorie Goals** based on someone's diet
   
   -**Sort and Save Recipes** a user may want to visit later on
   
   -**Hide Recipes** that conflict with dietary restrictions
   
* **Sketches** reflect a users ability to find a recipe, apply filters, and sign up for an account.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

During this sprint, we focused on **designing the user interface** through **wireframes**, creating
a **low-fidelity prototype**. After that, we had **fellow UX designers** perform **cognitive
walkthroughs of our wireframe** so that we could get feedback on our design. This was done by
having our designers **walk through** the steps one of our **personas** would take to complete a **scenario**.

The **Cognitive Walkthroughs** showed us what we have right while also pointing out places of
improvement:
* Overall, the designers were **successful** in **completing each scenario**.
   -They were able to **search recipes, find recipes, and execute filters**
* They were **unsuccessful** in:

   -**Determining** the **difficulty rating** of a recipe
 
   -**Finding tips** and tricks
   
* **A New Persona and Scenario** have been **added** to reflect a **change in focus* for the *next sprint*
   -**Adding a Homepage Blog** as opposed to a separate page
* **Discontinuing Tips and Tricks Page**
* **A Wireframe** has been added to the report

# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

**Executive Summary**
For our final sprint, we focused on fine tuning the interface to **develop a prototype**. Afterwords, we took the 
prototype and **performed user testing** with our UX classmates.

The **User Testing** was largely successful. The main functions we wanted to test were:
* **Search Function and Filter Execution** - No problems with search, one user wasn't able to find the filters at first
* **Saving and Sharing Recipes** - No issues saving, one user was mildly confused about which link they should use for sharing the recipe
* **Posting a Blog Entry** - No issues, users both went to the blog page and posted directly on the home page
* **Make a Profile** - No issues

From the tests we learned our current set up is very successful. We will need to make the filter button **more clearly labeled as a filter button**.
The **blog** aspect of our prototype was very successful as well and **helps differentiate our product** from what is already out there now.
**The Prototype has been added to the repository**

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

It can be very challenging figuring out what to eat 3 times a day and harder still if you are under any sort of dietary restrictions. **What's For Dinner will allow a user to have access to a collection of recipes tailored for them,** making the decision of What's For Dinner much easier. We've done some research to find opportunities to improve the user experience.

**Competative Analysis** of leading products revealed **opportunities for improvement** for multiple segments:
* **Advertisements**: Users displeased with **advertisements swarming the user interface**
* **Pay Walls**: A lot of **useful functionality hidden behind monthly paywalls**
* **Tutorials**: Sometimes **kitchen jargon is confusing** for inexperienced users and **few competitors** provided **definitions of jargon and tutorials for tasks** 
* **Shopping List**: Many platforms allowed for the **creation of a shopping list** but few took into account **ingredients you already have**
**Heuristic evaluation** of a competitor showed that navigation of the site was easily learnable but some functionality was hidden from the user at first glance.
* New Personas and Scenarios reflect what we have learned through our analyses and our goals moving forward:

   -**Setting Calorie Goals** based on someone's diet
   
   -**Sort and Save Recipes** a user may want to visit later on
   
   -**Hide Recipes** that conflict with dietary restrictions
   
* **Sketches** reflect a users ability to find a recipe, apply filters, and sign up for an account.

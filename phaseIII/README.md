# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

The Whats4Dinner team executed a usability study in our third phase to evaluate our current prototype’s functionality and design by accessing how users interacted with the prototype and listening to their feedback. We gave each participate five tasks to complete within the prototype, then asked them questions regarding the task once they had finished, followed by a series of debriefing questions once the study was completed.

Task 1: The users were tasked to find a gluten free mac and cheese recipie. This test allowed us to examine how users iintereacted with the search bar as well as the search filters.

Task 2: The users were asked to save a recipe of their choice, then find that recipe in their cookbooks. This task tested how quickly users were able to save a recipe then locate their saves.

Task 3: This task asked the users to post a blog to the website. This test allowed us to examine how prominent the blog section of our design was and how easily users were able to locate and use it.

Task 4: This task asked the users to create an account on the prototype. This task revealed how functional our account creation center was for users.

Task 5: This task asked the users to share a recipe outside of our platform. This allowed us to evaluate the functionality of our share features and their ease of use.

After each task, the users were asked to rank the ease of completion from 1-10, where 1 is “very easy” and 10 is “very difficult.”


## Findings

Task 1: The users found this task very easy to complete, giving it an average difficulty rating of 2.75/10. One participant expressed slight confusion on where the filter button was located but found it quickly.

Task 2: The users found this task to be extremely easy, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.75/10. There was no confusion regarding this task.

Task 3: The users found this task extremely easy, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.5/10. There was no confusion regarding this task.

Task 4: The users found this task extremely easy, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.5/10. There was no confusion regarding this task.

Task 5: The users found this task very easy to complete, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.4/10. There was moderate confusion expressed by one participant regarding the difference between share links on the platform but they were ultimately able to compete the task swiftly.


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

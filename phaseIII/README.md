# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

The focus of the final sprint was to fine tune the usability of our product through user testing of a prototype. Specifically, we focused on the learnability,
satisfaction of use, and efficiency of use. We also implemented a blog feature in our website to differentiate our site from others.

## Methods

The Whats4Dinner team executed a usability study in our third phase to evaluate our current prototype’s functionality and design by accessing how users interacted with the prototype and listening to their feedback. We gave each participate five tasks to complete within the prototype, then asked them questions regarding the task once they had finished, followed by a series of debriefing questions once the study was completed.

Task 1: The users were tasked to find a gluten free mac and cheese recipie. This test allowed us to examine how users intereacted with the search bar as well as the search filters.

Task 2: The users were asked to save a recipe of their choice, then find that recipe in their cookbooks. This task tested how quickly users were able to save a recipe then locate their saves.

Task 3: This task asked the users to post a blog to the website. This test allowed us to examine how prominent the blog section of our design was and how easily users were able to locate and use it.

Task 4: This task asked the users to create an account on the prototype. This task revealed how functional our account creation center was for users.

Task 5: This task asked the users to share a recipe outside of our platform. This allowed us to evaluate the functionality of our share features and their ease of use.

After each task, the users were asked to rank the ease of completion from 1-10, where 1 is “very easy” and 10 is “very difficult.”


## Findings

Task 1: The users found this task moderately easy to complete, giving it an average difficulty rating of 2.75/10. One participant expressed slight confusion on where the filter button was located but found it quickly.

Task 2: The users found this task to be extremely easy, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.75/10. There was no confusion regarding this task.

Task 3: The users found this task extremely easy, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.5/10. There was no confusion regarding this task.

Task 4: The users found this task extremely easy, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.5/10. There was no confusion regarding this task.

Task 5: The users found this task very easy to complete, giving it an average difficulty rating of 1.4/10. There was moderate confusion expressed by one participant regarding the difference between share links on the platform but they were ultimately able to compete the task swiftly.


## Conclusions

The usability study resulted in mostly positive feedback from our subjects. The biggest issue our subjects faced was within task 1, involving the "filter search" tab. With our research completed thusfar, it is uncertain whether the buttons functionality is unclear to the subjects or if our current prototype is too low fidelity for a natural user experience. A second usability study should be conducted with a higher fidelity prototype to compare test results.
 

## Caveats

The fidelity of our prototype was slighty too low for a natural user experience. Since our team was limited by the Adobe XD software, our prototype did not take typed keyboard input. This input would have been useful for our user to type keywords into the recipe search bar. Without this functionality, some users reported confusion regarding needing to use the filter functionality instead of typing keywords. In addition, our test subjects were limited demographically since all subjects were very technologically literate.

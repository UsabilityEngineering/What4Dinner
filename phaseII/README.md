# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

During this sprint, we were focused on creating and fine tuning the user interface. To do this, we built a wireframe in Adobe XD and we had fellow UX designers conduct a cognitive walkthrough of our wireframe. 

## Methods

In Phase II of the development of Whats4Dinner, our team created wireframes and conducted cognitive walkthroughs to test the functionality and efficiency of the Whats4Dinner platform.

The basic wireframes we created were comprehensive outlines of the Whats4DInner platform that featured qualities that the final Whats4Dinner interface will include, such as rating systems, search filters, and personalizable cookbooks. These wireframes were upgraded to low-fidelity prototypes that a user is able to interact with. Interactions such as moving from page to page, clicking buttons, and saving recipes were possible.


Cognitive Walkthroughs were conducted by the Whats4Dinner team to assess the functionality of these low-fidelity prototypes. Personas and scenarios of potential users of Whats4Dinner were given to those performing the walkthroughs. These scenarios included multiple specific goals the user was to complete in their walkthrough. These cognitive walkthroughs aimed to analyze how successful the participants were in completing their tasks and how effectively they moved throughout the prototype.

## Findings

Creating the basic wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes allowed the Whats4Dinner team to flush out the layout of the platform and create a draft of the final interface. Doing so revealed minor obstacles such as where to put buttons and how to layout the platform most effectively. These obstacles were easily surpassed.

The cognitive walkthrough evaluations yielded valuable insight into the current functionality of Whats4Dinner. 

An evaluator attempting to complete the cognitive walkthrough for Winshmuckâ€™s Weekend described difficulty with assessing search results. When searching for the difficulty of the selected recipe, they interpreted our star system as a quality rating system rather than an ease-to-difficulty scale. This has prompted us into updating our rating system in Phase III to better reflect its intended purpose. We plan to use symbols other than stars as they are commonly equated with quality, as well as add a clear label underneath it.

Another participant in our cognitive walkthroughs expressed a want for more specific difficulty filters when searching for recipes. This would involve adding an ease-to-difficulty search option available as well as the ease-to-difficulty scale tag on each individual recipe. This is something the Whats4Dinner team intends to pursue in the 3rd phase of our development after discussion without software developers.


## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

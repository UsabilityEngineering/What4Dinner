# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

During this sprint, we were focused on creating and fine tuning the user interface. To do this, we built a wireframe in Adobe XD and we had fellow UX designers conduct a cognitive walkthrough of our wireframe. 

## Methods

In Phase II of the development of Whats4Dinner, our team created wireframes and conducted cognitive walkthroughs to test the functionality and efficiency of the Whats4Dinner platform.

The basic wireframes we created were comprehensive outlines of the Whats4DInner platform that featured qualities that the final Whats4Dinner interface will include, such as rating systems, search filters, and personalizable cookbooks. These wireframes were upgraded to low-fidelity prototypes that a user is able to interact with. Interactions such as moving from page to page, clicking buttons, and saving recipes were possible.


Cognitive Walkthroughs were conducted by the Whats4Dinner team to assess the functionality of these low-fidelity prototypes. Personas and scenarios of potential users of Whats4Dinner were given to those performing the walkthroughs. These scenarios included multiple specific goals the user was to complete in their walkthrough. These cognitive walkthroughs aimed to analyze how successful the participants were in completing their tasks and how effectively they moved throughout the prototype.

## Findings

Creating the basic wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes allowed the Whats4Dinner team to flesh out the layout of the platform and create a draft of the final interface. Doing so revealed minor obstacles such as where to put buttons and how to layout the platform most effectively. These obstacles were easily surpassed.

The cognitive walkthrough evaluations yielded valuable insight into the current functionality of Whats4Dinner. 

An evaluator attempting to complete the cognitive walkthrough for Winshmuckâ€™s Weekend described difficulty with assessing search results. When searching for the difficulty of the selected recipe, they interpreted our star system as a quality rating system rather than an ease-to-difficulty scale. This has prompted us into updating our rating system in Phase III to better reflect its intended purpose. We plan to use symbols other than stars as they are commonly equated with quality, as well as add a clear label underneath it.

Another participant in our cognitive walkthroughs expressed a want for more specific difficulty filters when searching for recipes. This would involve adding an ease-to-difficulty search option available as well as the ease-to-difficulty scale tag on each individual recipe. This is something the Whats4Dinner team intends to pursue in the 3rd phase of our development after discussion without software developers.


## Conclusions
Through the cognitive walkthroughs along with our own development of a wireframe, we were able to fine tune our application and narrow our scope even further.

The cognitive walkthrough provided helpful critiques of our wireframe that allowed us to improve our work. Specifically, we saw that tips and tricks were both hard to find and not very useful for our personas and scenarios. In addition, users were unable to discern recipe difficulty and time. Not to mention adding tips and tricks would take away time from more important features such as filters or creating a profile. 

Along with the walkthrough, developing the wireframe provided a good draft for the layout of our website. With input from our software engineers, we decided to focus more on the social media aspect of the site. This decision was based on our goal of making our product different from the rest of the competition we analyzed in the previous sprint.

## Caveats

The largest caveat we encountered was the fact that our cognitive walkthroughs were only performed by fellow UX designers. Not only that but everyone was about the same age and had the same tech experience level due to them all being computer scientists. Another caveat we had was the wireframe didn't yet reflect our change in focus towards more social media interaction.
